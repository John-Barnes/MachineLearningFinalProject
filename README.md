# MachineLearningFinalProject
This is a simple submissions repository for the final project in the Coursera/Johns Hopkins course "Machine Learning."  
  
  It contains the .Rmd, .md, and .html for my final project.

I will try to put in a gh-branch to make this readable in github, but am not sure I’ll have time before deadline.  If not, the html should read just fine in your browser; please cut and paste from “raw,” and thank you for your patience.
